Setting up an Application Load Balancer for Amazon ECS

A load balancer can have one listener per protocol/port.
Each listener has multiple rules.
Each rule has a path and a target group attached.

http only on instances - and only open to alb group.
Open custom ports (ie 5600) only to alb & automated build/test projects.
Need :80 open for health checks? (No. Health checks can be directed to any port using the advanced settings.)
