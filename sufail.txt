Your startup is probably going to fail

If your primary source of income is advertising, you're building a house on a foundation of Jello.

Bringing in a secured lender is inviting the hangman to dinner.

You're not out of the woods with your first million, your first year, or even your first decade. (When do you stop being a startup?) (See ChaCha failure.)
